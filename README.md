# DCL
Decentralized Cryptographic Ledger in .NET Core (cross platform).This is meant as sandbox, so only use it as such.
What is it???
Everyone tasks about Bitcoin etc. Well, most coins are directly forked of Bitcoin (for example Litecoin) / Cryptonote (for example Monero). Mostly building onto a foundation which is, in its high-level design in my opinion outdated. It generates blocks to secure the network and therewith rewarding miners of this pointless guessing game with a reward.  
This imposes 3 problems:
- Enormous (useless) power consumption
- Low max TX per second speed (or your blockchain size will grow enormously if you would have, for example, 10000 px per sec.)
- Mining companies have the power and basically get all rewards (rich become richer) and therewith it isn't decentralized at all

This project is my own search for a faster, more "green" alternative (even though it's just a hobby for me, so don't expect professional plug and play solutions from this). Let's rethink how an actual decentralized solution without blocks and without silly guessing games will look like and how it can still be secure enough.

If you want to give it a go, here the build instructions: 
- Install Visual Studio 2015/2017 Community<BR>
- Open project .SLN<BR>
- Change the code if you want to
- Build :-P<BR>
- Wait a minute, in my case: <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="coffee" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2615.png">☕️</g-emoji><BR>
- Enjoy
